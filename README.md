This project analyzes data from a German mail-order business. It reduces the dataset using PCA, and then compares the demographics of customers to the demographics of the general population using clustering. I determine that customers are generally wealthier and live in suburbs, as compared to the general German resident. This was my final project for a Udacity Data Analysis nanodegree. The data I used was proprietary, and is not available to share publicly and can no longer be accessed. The Jupyter notebook won't run without the data; if you're using it to see my work, then I suggest you review the accompanying html file instead.
